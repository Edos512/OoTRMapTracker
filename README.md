This is a pack for [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/) designed for the [Ocarina of Time Randomizer](https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer).

It allows to keep track of your current item loadout and has maps with all item locations for child and adult Link. These locations get filtered by your current item loadout to only show what you can actually reach.

If you have any questions regarding the pack or the tracker itself, I recommend just asking in the EmoTracker discord.
